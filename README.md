# 🎓 CS:GO Practice Script
## Small script that lets you setup handy practice gamemode on your private CS:GO server using one easy to remember command!

With my file, you can easily practice different grenades, jumps, tricks, prefires or tactics solo or with your friends on any chosen map. After loading my script on the server, you get:
- Unlimited money
- Unlimited ammo and throwables
- Infinite roundtime
- All 6 grenades (Molotov, Decoy, Flash, HE, Smoke and Tactical)
- Acces to `noclip`, `god` and rest of `sv_cheats 1` commands
- Automatical respawn
And many, many more - **all toggleable inside the script**, based on your own preferences!

This project is fully maintained by a single person. If you really enjoy it & would want to support my work, [you can buy me a small coffee here. I would gladly appreciate it!](https://ko-fi.com/kondiu)

:beginner: **This script is 100% safe and legal, you can't get banned because of it on any server even if it is secured by VAC, Easy AC, FACEIT AC or any other possible anticheat application. It also won't change any of your personal CS:GO settings.**
